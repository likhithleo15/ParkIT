Tesseract OCR installation (required for plate recognition):

Windows:
1. Download and install Tesseract from:
   https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases (choose the appropriate exe)
2. After install, note the install path, e.g. C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
3. In your environment or in app.py set pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd to that path.

macOS:
1. Install via Homebrew:
   brew install tesseract

Linux (Ubuntu):
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev

After installation, verify:
$ tesseract --version

If Tesseract is not available, the app will still run but ANPR OCR will fail; you'll be able to use manual entry fallback.
